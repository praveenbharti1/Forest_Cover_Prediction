# Forest Cover Type Prediction 🌲🌳🌴

This project aims to create a predictive model that can accurately classify seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado, based on the given dataset. The dataset contains 581,012 instances and 54 features, including 10 numerical features and 44 binary features. The target variable is the forest cover type, which has seven possible values: Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas-fir, and Krummholz.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing 📊🔍🧹

Before building the predictive model, we performed some exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing steps to understand the data better and prepare it for the machine learning algorithm. These steps included:

- Imputing the categorical features to their original form, so that we could visualize them and understand their relationship with the target variable. We used the information from the [data description] to map the one-hot encoded features to their corresponding soil type and wilderness area.
- Removing the outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method, to reduce the noise and variance in the data. We identified the outliers by plotting boxplots for each numerical feature and calculated the IQR for each feature. We removed the instances that had values outside the range of Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR, where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartiles, respectively.
- Applying a power transformation to the numerical features, to make them more Gaussian-like and reduce the skewness. We used the [PowerTransformer] from scikit-learn, which applies a Yeo-Johnson transformation to each feature. We plotted histograms and Q-Q plots for each feature before and after the transformation to compare the distributions and normality.
- One-hot encoding the categorical features again, to prepare them for the machine learning algorithm. We used the [OneHotEncoder] from scikit-learn, which encodes the categorical features as binary vectors.

## Model Building and Evaluation 🛠️👷‍♂️👩‍🔬

After these steps, we divided the data into independent and dependent variables, and then split them into training and testing sets. We used a 70:30 split ratio and set the random state to 42 for reproducibility. We applied various ML algorithms to evaluate their performance and selected the top two ML algorithms with the highest performance for hyper-parameter tuning to reduce any bias in their results. The ML algorithms we used were:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Extra-Tree Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Boosting Classifier

We used the accuracy score as the main metric to compare the models, as well as the confusion matrix and the classification report to check the precision, recall, and f1-score for each class. We also plotted the learning curves for each model to check the bias-variance trade-off and the convergence of the training and validation scores.

The best performing ML algorithms were:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier

We performed hyper-parameter tuning on these two algorithms using the [GridSearchCV] from scikit-learn, which performs an exhaustive search over the specified parameter values and returns the best estimator. We used a 5-fold cross-validation and the accuracy score as the scoring function. We tried different combinations of parameters for each algorithm and found the optimal values that maximized the accuracy score.

## Model Selection and Deployment 🚀👏🎉

After hyper-parameter tuning, we found that Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other algorithm. It achieved an accuracy score of 83.86%, which is quite good for predicting the forest cover type. We also checked the feature importance of the Random Forest Classifier and found that the most important features were Elevation, Horizontal Distance To Hydrology, Horizontal Distance To Roadways, and Wilderness Area 4.



## Conclusion and Future Work 📝👍👩‍💻

In this project, we created a predictive model that can classify the forest cover type based on the given dataset. We performed data exploration and preprocessing, model building and evaluation, model selection and deployment, and achieved a satisfactory accuracy score. We also learned a lot about the forest cover types and the features that affect them.

Some possible future work for this project are:

- Trying different data preprocessing techniques, such as scaling, normalization, or feature selection, to improve the data quality and reduce the dimensionality. 📏🔢🔎
- Trying different ML algorithms, such as neural networks, XGBoost, or CatBoost, to improve the model performance and accuracy. 🧠🚀🐱
- Trying different hyper-parameter tuning methods, such as random search, Bayesian optimization, or genetic algorithms, to find the optimal parameter values more efficiently and effectively. 🎲🔮🧬
- Adding more features to the dataset, such as climate, vegetation, or soil properties, to capture more information and variability in the data. 🌡️🌿🌱
- Adding more functionality to the Flask app, such as data visualization, user feedback, or error handling, to make it more user-friendly and robust. 📊👍🚫
